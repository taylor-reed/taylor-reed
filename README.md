# Hi there 👋

📷 Photographer by heart, coder by accident.  
☕ Most of my experiments start after midnight and end in something I don’t fully remember building.  

🌐 You might find some of my career stuff "linked" elsewhere online — if you're curious enough.

Feel free to browse my projects, or just enjoy the randomness.  
Happy hunting!
